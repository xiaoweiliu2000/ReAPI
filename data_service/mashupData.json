When we work with image enlargement we usually meet problems with creating new pixels that have been added. Standard approach gives a blur effect in the image, if we estimate pixels as average of neighbouring pixels. And in that case the image looks like a stretched image and it has a blur effect. In the approach on Image Upscaler website we use Deep Learning GAN - generative adversarial network to approximate pixels. In this approach images save their quality, they have no blur effect and look more natural like in the real world if you take photos with a better camera or with smaller distance. At the first stage, GAN Generative Adversarial Networks have been trained on high photo databases. It helps the algorithm to understand how the natural object looks in real life. When you upload an image, AI Image Upscaler scans it, and generates new pixels for bigger images, and these pixels look like they should be in the real world. As a result, you get a higher resolution image.You can upscale images in JPG, JPEG, PNG formats. Image Upscaler works with any image, but you will get a better result using photos that were not previously blurred or upscaled. The website shows better results on anime, logos, cartoon pictures, or any other synthesized image."

Click to bring up the source document or create a new visualization based on the cited or cited application or patent.This widget is a simple prototype application that employs \"screen scraping\" written in PHP 7 to gather data from Google Patents. It then formats the data about patents and patent applications it cites or other that cite this patent or application on a timeline that can be interacted with. It has been tested with the Google Chrome browser and requires JavaScript to be allowed to run. As a screen scraper, the results may sometimes be unexpected, but this approach was required after Google discontinued its direct API. It uses live up to date data from Google Patents (both the old and new version). Please contact us by clicking here to comment or ask for additional features."

However, most page refreshes will require cached data to be refetched from one or more web service - maximum cache time is between one hour and 12 hours, due to restrictions on caching imposed by web service providers.Still, the results are very consistent, only limited by the accuracy of UPC data provided by third parties - at an estimate, less than 1% of UPC searches have products with wrongly-allocated UPCs."

Just click Radius+ to increase search area...Still using google search? Better use (twitter geo powered) search within!BTW, how about vine.co twitter videos from the place? Sure, click THE VINES to watch it playlisted...Under tweets feel free to check what's top on Amazon by random category (at the moment from 10 available global locations)!Just under Random Pics spoiler are random space cats pics (for your pleasure)."

But, sometimes a friend checks in while you're busy - at dinner, seeing a movie, etc. You want to hang out with them when you're free, but you won't unless you put in a lot of effort into co-ordinating plans for later. That's where HangoutLater comes in. When you checkin somewhere, HangoutLater notifies you on Foursquare that one or more of your friends have checked in close by recently. It then suggests a fun place between all of you where you guys can meet up when you're free."

The applets in the portal can communicate with and include a broad range of information sources which existinside or outside of the organization. The context intelligence of the portal also provides a predictive capability that determines if information needs to be presented to the user without the user explicitly asking for that data. This is an important departure from the state of current ERP which requires that information be explicitly integrated into the ERP application."

It allows the user to get introduced to unknown musicians through their favorite ones in a friendly way. Inflooenz creates a playlist with the very best of each influencer to showcase their work and populates other relevant information for a friendly first approach. Its main difference against other recommendation engines is that 'influence' is a wider concept than similarity: while still related to a starting point (the favorite artist), the user can come up with new music that it's not 'more of the same'."

It was designed to be a proof of concept of how you can use the fact that Siri can send emails along with [SendGrid's Parse API](http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/api/parse-api-2/) to create your own custom Siri API.When you are done with this tutorial, you will be able to ask Siri to motivate you and Siri will oblidge by calling you via Twilio to tell you \"You are Awesome.\" :)I hope that you take this concept to the next level and dream up interesting things for Siri to do. At the [SendGrid Mobile Hackday](http://sendgridmh.eventbrite.com/) a few developers asked Siri to check them into Foursquare, post to Twitter and remotely launch apps on their Macs."

Nationally, there were 124 million ED visits in 2011, of which the CDC estimates 50% could be handled in a primary care setting. With an average charge for each ED encounter approaching $700 vs. the average physician office charge of $150, every patient redirected away from the ED saves the payor $550. This represents a total potential market savings of $34 billion for facilitating correct use of primary care.Providing people with the tools they need to find appropriate care everywhere saves everyone, hospitals and patients, money and time.Patients receive a SMS from triage.me post emergency room discharge. By sending a text to triage.me with their problem and current address, we route the person towards the nearest clinic, providing the address and a link to directions (for smartphone users).Many clinics that work with the underinsured also often have variable hours and locations. We've made it easy for these clinics to update their hours and location via SMS so that we can better route triage.me users to locations."

Along the same lines of speed dating, our phone conversations or \"mini dates\" are limited to three minutes each. This is enough time for users to meet each other and chat but not too much time in case someone isn't interested or doesn't feel a connection. When the three minutes are up, users are asked if they would like to continue the conversation. If both users say \"yes\", the connection stays open and they can talk on MiniDat.es for as long as they want. But if someone says \"no\", the connection is closed and both people go their separate ways. No hurt feelings, no need to \"let her down easily\" and no awkward, half-hug on your doorstep."

        "Description": "\"PTDC\" is an application for public transportation riders. At the backend we use Public Transit Data Community API that provides us with aggregated real-time transit data from transportation agencies of District of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland. The application has three major features: - \"Where Am I\" - if you get lost in some neighborhood and don't know how to get home. This functionality is for you. It tells you what buses or metro lines is nearby your current GPS location, maps the routes on map and gives directions and arrivals for the stops. - \"Next Transport\" - It is a quick access to nearby arrivals. The list could be filtered by your favorite's stops and routes. - \"Trip Planer\" - that is a hit of the season. Build a trip from any places to any mixing transport operated by several transit providers."
